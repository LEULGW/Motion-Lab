# Interactive Physics Learning Website

## Project Summary
This project is an interactive physics learning website that simulates two major physics concepts:
1. **Projectile Motion Simulation** – Users enter velocity, angle, and gravity. The program animates the projectile path and shows whether it hits the target.
2. **Double Mass-Spring System Simulation** – Users adjust spring constants, masses, and friction, then drag a mass to start the oscillation. The motion animates in real time.

The goal is to make physics more fun, visual, and easy to understand for students.

## How to Run the Program
1. Open **index.html** in any web browser (Chrome recommended).
2. Click on the simulation dropdown and choose either **Projectile Motion** or **Double Mass-Spring System**.
3. Adjust the sliders and watch the animation update in real time.

No installation required — the project runs entirely in the browser.

## Dependencies / Libraries Used
The website uses the following libraries:

- **p5.js** (for animation and graphics)  
  Loaded via CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.9.0/lib/p5.min.js`

- **HTML & CSS** for the interface  
- **JavaScript** for physics calculations and interactivity  

No backend, no external datasets, no installation required.
